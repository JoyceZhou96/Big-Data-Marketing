#Q1. One advantage of using ggplot2 is its flexibility of distinguishing data of different categories by using different parameters such as size, fill, colour, and shape. Try to plot a point chart using “countries.csv” uploaded in LumiNUS. Think of a smart way to distinguish the countries by their continent, population, GDP per capita, and life expectation.
You may refer to the scatter plot in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy to understand what I meant by distinguishing data by size and colour.

library(ggplot2)
countries<-read.csv('D:/课程/BDM/Lecture 3/countries.csv',header=T,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

ggplot(countries,aes(x=log (GDP_Per_Capita),y=Life_Expectancy))+geom_point(aes(colour =Continent,size = Population,shape = Continent),alpha = 4/10)+stat_smooth(method="lm", se=FALSE)+theme(legend.position = c(0.98,0.02),legend.justification = c("right", "bottom"))



#Q2. Download “srx new.csv” from LumiNUS. The file contains around 2000 sample records of properties listed on SRX website. Please use ggplot2 to develop 5 different charts to visualise Singapore property market from different aspects. Write a brief summary about your findings for each chart.
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
srx<-read.csv('D:/课程/BDM/Lecture 3/srx new.csv',header=T,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
ggplot(srx,aes(x = PSF.Builtup.sqft,y = Asking.new)) + geom_point()+stat_smooth()+xlim(0,4000)+ylim(100000,30000000)

#Conclusion :From the graphic, we could conclude that prices of houses have positive relation with the area of houses. To be more specific, as the area of a house increases, the price climbs as well.




library(scales)
srx_type <- na.omit(srx$Property.Type.)
srx_type[grep("HDB",srx_type)] <- "HDB"
srx_type_df <-as.data.frame(table(srx_type))
ggplot(srx_type_df,aes(x = "",y = Freq, fill= srx_type))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")+coord_polar("y",start=0)+scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues")+ggtitle ("Distribution for Different Property Types")+ theme_void()


#Conclusion: From the graphic, we could conclude that Condominium houses are the most property type in Singapore. Houses in HDB and Condominium type dominate more than the half of property markets.


srx_District <- na.omit(srx$District.)
srx_District <- as.data.frame(substr(srx_District,1,4))
colnames(srx_District) <- "District"
srx_District_df <- as.data.frame(table(srx_District))
ggplot(srx_District_df,aes(x = reorder(srx_District, -Freq),  y = Freq, fill =srx_District))+geom_bar(stat = "identity")+coord_flip()

#Conculsion: From the bar graphic we could see District D19 and D9 concentrate the most two properties, while D22 and D13 have the less two properties.


Year <- as.data.frame(na.omit(srx$Built.Year.))
colnames(Year) <- "Year"
ggplot(Year) + geom_density(aes(x=Year), binwidth=5, fill="lightblue") +ggtitle("Yearly New Property")


From the graphic, we know that the amount of  properties increases wavily; After 1998, the number of  properties exploded, but since 2015 decreases dramatically (why?).

options(scipen =200)
ggplot(srx,aes(x=Asking.new)) + geom_density(fill = "lightblue")+xlim(220000,15000000)


#Conclusion: From the graphic we could get a conculsion that after the house amount reach its peak at a certain price, its distribution follows exponential distribution; Before this price, the number of houses increases exponentially.


#Q3. As explained in class, convert the Singapore residence data into a more flexible structure.

```{r}
library(stringr) 
residents<-read.csv('D:/课程/BDM/Lecture 3/singapore-residents-by-age-group-ethnic-group-and-sex-end-june-annual.csv',header=T,stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
residents <- as.data.frame(residents)


colnames(residents) <- c('year','type','age_range','population') # rename column name

# clean age
res <- residents[which(residents$age_range != "65 Years & Over" & residents$age_range !="70 Years & Over" & residents$age_range !="75 Years & Over"& residents$age_range !="85 Years & Over"),]  # clean age

#add identity "gender"
res$gender <- ifelse(grepl("Male",res$type), "Male",ifelse(grepl("Female",res$type),"Female","None")) 
res <- res[which(res$gender!="None"),]

#add identity "ethnic"
res$type <- word(res$type,-1) 
res$type[which(grepl("(Males)",res$type)|grepl("(Females)",res$type))] <- "Other Ethnic"


colnames(res) <- c('Year','Ethnic','Age_range','Population','Gender') #rename again

#Fill "na" with mean
res$Population[which(res$Population == "na" & res$Age_range == "70 - 74 Years")] <- round(mean.default(as.numeric(res$Population[res$Age_range == "70 - 74 Years"]),na.rm = TRUE),0)

res$Population[which(res$Population == "na" & res$Age_range == "75 - 79 Years")] <- round(mean.default(as.numeric(res$Population[res$Age_range == "75 - 79 Years"]),na.rm = TRUE),0)

res$Population[which(res$Population == "na" & res$Age_range == "80 - 84 Years")] <- round(mean.default(as.numeric(res$Population[res$Age_range == "80 - 84 Years"]),na.rm = TRUE),0)

res$Population[which(res$Population == "na" & res$Age_range == "80 Years & Over")] <- round(mean.default(as.numeric(res$Population[res$Age_range == "80 Years & Over"]),na.rm = TRUE),0)

res
```
